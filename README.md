Latitude Interest Free Plugins for WooCommerce (AU and NZ)

# History

1. This repo was created on 1 Oct 2024 by importing https://github.com/latitude-checkout/checkout-plugins-woocommerce/.
2. https://github.com/latitude-checkout/checkout-plugins-woocommerce/ is the public-facing repo that LFS no longer has to.
3. Having access is not important, because WordPress plugin must be maintained in WordPress SVN:
   - https://wordpress.org/plugins/latitude-interest-free-gateway-for-woocommerce/#developers
   - https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/latitude-interest-free-gateway-for-woocommerce/
   - https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/latitude-interest-free-gateway-for-woocommerce/
4. Additional work to the plugin must always be done here and then subsequently exported to the SVN.

# Why are there 2 readmes?

1. `README.md` is for LFS internal.
2. `readme.txt` is utilised by WordPress and WooCommerce.
